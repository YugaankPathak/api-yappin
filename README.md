## Future Scope

- **Clothing Detection and Classification on the API side**: Future enhancements could include adding machine learning models for the detection and classification of apparel from uploaded images. This could allow users to upload images of clothing and have the system automatically classify them into categories like formal, casual, or traditional, and further distinguish between male and female apparel.

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Implementing more personalized outfit recommendations based on weather, events, and preferences learned over time from user behavior and outfit combinations.

- **Outfit Scoring System**: Introduce a rating or scoring system where users can rate their outfit combinations, and the system can use this data to provide better recommendations in the future.
